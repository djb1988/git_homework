This repository has two programs inside of it.

1- Ruby Pyramid
2- Url Parser

Both programs are written in Ruby and can be run from the Terminal. To run the Pyramid program, 
you need to run the command "ruby pyramid(x)" where "x" is the argument so you need to enter a
fixnum in its place when you run the code. The x value is the total number of rows that the
pyramid will have when you run it.

The URL Parser can also be run from the Terminal but its job is to break down a URL to the
individual parts. You run the program by typing "ruby url_parser(url)" into the Terminal.
"url" is the argument for the program so you should enter a full url in its place.

Happy Coding!
